Fun fact, there's only one .atwho-query element on the page at any given time,
so if you see `$ .atwho-query`, it's targeting one particular element.

What does catchQuery do entirely?
  Catch query is fired on keyup, and given an keyup event, known as `e`

  1. Early exit for <Enter>
  2. Firefox handling
  3. "Modifying inserted element" (correcting any local .atwho-* classes)
  4. Handle arrow keys (*did a fix here)
  5. What to do if you are inside an inserted text and do something
    5.1 Backspace = delete the inserted text
    5.2 Character = keep text, but it no longer counts as inserted text anymore

  The function quits right away if there is no range, or if there is a range, but it isn't just the cursor
  position (ie, if the user has something highlighted, nothing happens in this function)

  EARLY EXIT: catchQuery exists if it was called as a consequence of an <Enter> keypress, doing the following:
    * It unwraps the nearest `.atwho-query` element, meaning that this happens:
      "<span class='atwho-query'>Mar</span>" =Becomes=> "Mar"
    * Some special handling has to happen if the query was empty
    * The last `.atwho-query` element on the page gets unwrapped, with no reasoning or explanation provided... :(
    That's all that catchQuery does if the user presses <Enter>

  Next, some Firefox-specific stuff happens.
    * If the cursor is positioned at the beginning of the input element, the "ranges are cleared". I'm not entirely
      what that means, but I do know that when I call it in the console, whatever I have highlighted get un-highlighted
    * Some special stuff happens if you press backspace in Firefox too, I'll skip it for now

  A few stumbling blocks:
    range.startContainer. According to Mozilla, this is going to be the DOM element that the range begins IN. This
      is used a lot to determine if the selection / cursor position is inside of an inserted text or something
    jQuery's `closest` function could also have been named `firstParent`, because that's what it does

  Next, if we are inside an .atwho-inserted, ...
    * Revoke the .atwho-query class from everyone else and pin it on this one
    * If the query is empty, remove it away
    * If the user did anything other can press the arrow keys, mark this .atwho-inserted as no longer .atwho-inserted
